  this website for fun. Website focus on GIS , Remote Sensing, Geomatics and Cartography mostly in the state of Sarawak Malaysia. I would love to share my passion in geospatial and

{% include menu.html %}

Experimental and educational project that I created for my own use. Some of it I created to help me to solve some geographic mysteries :)

I will update on this soon.

{% for project in site.data.projects %}
<div class="project">
  <div class="project-image"
       style="{% if project.image %}background-image:url({{ project.image }});{% endif %}
              {% if project.color %}background-color:{{ project.color }};{% endif %}"></div>
  <h3><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.name }}</a></h3>
  <p>{{ project.description }}</p>
</div>
{% endfor %}
